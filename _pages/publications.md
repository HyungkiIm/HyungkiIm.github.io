description: My research focues on robust optimization/machine learning framework, where we seek for a solution that is robust against noise in the data. I have a particular interest in developing algorithms for large-scale robust optimization frameworks, such as Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). Additionally, I have experience in developing strong formulations for hybrid control systems, designed to enable real-time problem-solving.
