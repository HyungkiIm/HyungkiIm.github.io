I am a fifth-year Ph.D student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at UC Berkeley advised by Paul Grigas and Alper Atamturk. My research interest lies in machine learning, optimization, and data-driven decision making. Especially, I am interested in studying robust optimization/machine learning framework such as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and label noise detection. 

I finished my undergraduate in [Industrial Engineering](http://ie.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/) in 2019. I also did summer internship at [Theorem LP](https://www.theoremlp.com/) as a research scientist in 2023.
