I am a fifth-year Ph.D student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at UC Berkeley advised by Paul Grigas. My research interest lies in machine learning, optimization, and data-driven decision making. Especially, I am interested in studying robust optimization framework â€¦

I finished my undergraduate in [Industrial Engineering](http://ie.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/) in 2019. I also did summer internship at [Theorem LP](https://www.theoremlp.com/) as a research scientist in 2023.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
